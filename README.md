# <Joint Employee Payroll Tracker and Random Vacation Distributor>

It is important for any employer to track the names and wages of their employees. So I wrote a simple application that utilizes the input of the employer (via a series of prompts) to display an easily digestible grid of names and their respective salaries. This application also assists the employer by utilizing that same data to display their emploee's average salary. If that wasn't enough it also randomly selects one lucky employee to be sent on a permanent vacation to upstate New York. Beatiful beautiful uptate New York. 

## Usage

Here is a link to the deployed website. https://hevidevi.github.io/EmployeePayrollTracker/

The user should click the "Add Employee" button. They will be asked to confirm whether or not they would like to add a new member to the team. If they select "OK" then they will recevie three prompts asking for information about the employee. Once they are finished adding that employee they will be asked to confirm if they would like to add another. If they select "cancel" the employye's information will be stored in a table in alphabetical order. Then the user need only open the console to view the average salary of each employee submitted. In addition, one submitted employee will be randomly selected for permanent vactaion via a one way trip to upstae New York. Yay!
