# <Joint Employee Payroll Tracker and Random Vacation Distributor>

It is important for any employer to track the names and wages of their employees. So I wrote a simple application that utilizes the input of the employer (via a series of prompts) to display an easily digestible grid of names and their respective salaries. This application also assists the employer by utilizing that same data to display their emploee's average salary. If that wasn't enough it also randomly selects one lucky employee to be sent on a permanent vacation to upstate New York. Beatiful beautiful uptate New York. 

## Usage

Click the "Add Employee" button and you will be asked to confirm whether or not you would like to add a new member to the team. If you choose "OK" than the boolean value of confirmNewEmployee will be read as true and you will receive three consecutive prompts that request the first name, last name, and annual salary of the employee. The promts will appear in that order. Once the first employee's imformation is submitted the user will then be asked to confirm whether or not they would like to add another team member. If they select "OK" the boolean value of confirmNewEmployee will remain true and the prompts will repeat in the same order. if the user selects "cancel" then each employee's information will be displayed in a table from top to bottom in alpahabetical order. Then the user need only open the console to view the average salary of each employee submitted. In addition, one submitted employee will be randomly selected for permanent vactaion via a one ay trip to upstae New York. Congratulations!
